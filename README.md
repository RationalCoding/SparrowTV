<h4 align="center">Massively Scalable WebRTC Video Streaming</h4>
<br>

SparrowTV is a realtime video streaming platform that uses WebRTC and a tree model to scale.  
<a href="https://sparrowtv.herokuapp.com/">LIVE DEMO</a>

- No expensive video streaming server.
- No software installation (*for viewers with compatiable browsers*).
- MIT Licensed!

This low-cost alternative to traditional streaming servers allows anyone to run their own live-streaming service.



## TODO:
- Content integrity checks (currently, viewers can manipulate the streams they output).
- Better churn management.
- Increase outdegree based on bandwidth.
- Traditional fallback for non-WebRTC browsers.
- Streamer/chat moderation features.
