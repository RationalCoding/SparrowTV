<h4 align="center">Scalable P2P Real-Time Streaming over WebRTC</h4>
<br>

SparrowTV is a realtime video streaming platform that uses WebRTC and a tree model to scale.  
<a href="https://sparrowtv.herokuapp.com/">LIVE DEMO</a>

- Video streaming servers can cost millions of dollars. This removes the need entirely.  
- No software installation (*for viewers with compatiable browsers*).
- MIT Licensed!

This low-cost alternative to traditional streaming servers allows anyone to run their own live-streaming service.

## TODO (PRs Welcome!):
- Content integrity checks (currently, viewers could theoretically manipulate the streams they share).
- Better churn management.
- Increase outdegree based on bandwidth.
- Traditional fallback for non-WebRTC browsers.
- Streamer/chat moderation features.
- Aesthetics (emoji, themes, etc)
